## ABSTRACT
In the past two years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved rapid development anddemonstrated remarkable emerging capabilities. Concurrently, with powerful semantic
understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs have significantly empowered the rapidadvancement of the recommendation system field. Specifically, in news recommendation (NR), systems must comprehend and process a vast amount of clicked news text to infer the probabilityof candidate news clicks. This requirement exceeds the capabilities of traditional NR models but
aligns well with the strengths of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel NR algorithmto reshape
the news model via LLM Embedding and Co-Occurrence Pattern (LECOP). On one hand, we
fintuned LLM by contrastive learning using large-scale datasets to encode news, which can fullyexplore the semantic information of news to thoroughly identify user preferences. On the other
hand, we explored multiple co-occurrence patterns to mine collaborative information. Those
patterns include news ID co-occurrence, Item-Item keywords co-occurrence and Intra-Itemkeywords co-occurrence. The keywords mentioned above are all generated by LLM. As far as we
know, this is the first time that constructing such detailed Co-Occurrence Patterns via LLMtocapture collaboration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed novel method.
